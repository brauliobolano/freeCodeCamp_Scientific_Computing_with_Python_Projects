# freeCodeCamp_Scientific_Computing_with_Python_Projects
Welcome to my repository for the freeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python Certification projects! Here, you will find a collection of Python projects that I completed as part of my journey to master scientific computing concepts using Python.

This certification is offered by freeCodeCamp, a renowned platform for learning web development, data science, and programming. The Scientific Computing with Python Certification focuses on honing Python programming skills essential for data analysis, visualization, and solving scientific problems.

Project List:

1- Arithmetic Formatter: This project showcases my ability to create a simple arithmetic formatter that takes in a list of arithmetic problems and formats them vertically for easy readability.

2- Time Calculator: In this project, I have developed a time calculator that allows users to add a specified amount of time to a given time and obtain the result in a 12-hour clock format.

3- Budget App: I have implemented a budget application that helps users manage their finances by categorizing transactions and providing an overview of their spending.

4- Polygon Area Calculator: This project demonstrates my knowledge of object-oriented programming in Python to calculate the area of various polygons.

5- Probability Calculator: I have created a probability calculator that simulates experiments to estimate the likelihood of specified outcomes using probability principles.

Throughout the process of completing these projects, I have deepened my understanding of Python programming, algorithmic thinking, and data manipulation. Each project comes with its own set of challenges and problem-solving opportunities, and I have thoroughly enjoyed tackling them all.

Feel free to explore the individual project directories to view the source code, documentation, and any relevant notes I have included. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated, as they will help me continue growing as a Python developer and scientific computing enthusiast.

Thank you for visiting my freeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python Projects repository. Happy coding!
